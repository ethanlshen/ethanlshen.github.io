## About Me


<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hi! I am a student at the University of Washington double majoring in Computer Science and Math. I also study history on the side. I currently work as a research assistant at the [RAIVN Lab](https://raivn.cs.washington.edu/) under [Prof. Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/) and [Prof. Ranjay Krishna](https://www.ranjaykrishna.com/index.html). I work closely with [Aditya Kusupati](https://adityakusupati.github.io/) and [Matt Wallingford](https://mattwallingford.github.io/).

My current research interests include:
- Understanding the internal behavior of vision and language models.
- Efficient model architectures.
- AI and social/natural sciences.

**I will be joining the [AI2](https://allenai.org/) as a research intern starting March 2025, and Tesla FSD as a research intern starting September 2025.**

## Essays

1. **Gregory of Tours and Einhard: Clovis and Charlemagne**\
In this essay, I analyze the credibility of Einhard and Gregory of Tours as sources on Clovis and Charlemagne, two of the most influential figures in the Early Middle Ages.\

2. **The Detroit Riots of 1967**\
I contend that the Detroit Riots of 1967 were primarily caused by the decentralization of Detroit's automobile industry in the decade prior.\
